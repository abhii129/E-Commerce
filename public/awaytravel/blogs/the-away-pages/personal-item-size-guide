You check your pockets, prep your boarding pass, and hope your personal item bag fits under the seat in front of you. There's always a tiny bit of fear that you'll be that person, holding up the line to check a bag last minute.\nYou can check your fear with your luggage on your next trip, you won't be needing it at the gate. We're here to guide you through the personal item process. Whether making a long-haul journey or a quick hop, having a few essentials on hand can make or break the overall flight experience. And knowing that your personal item bag will perfectly fit  dimensions can save you the surprise of losing access to your stuff during a flight.\nBelow, we cover dimensions, size restrictions, and packing tips so you have everything you need for a comfortable flight without risking extra costs or loss. With this guide in mind, you can meander the airports and personal item restrictions with ease. Now let's get unpacking. \nWhat is a personal item, anyway?\nA personal item is, well, personal! Basically, it's a nifty little lightweight bag you bring on board to keep your essentials close by, like your lip balm, cellphone, and passport. Want to keep watching your current series? You can bring your laptop in your tote bag. Keen to continue turning the pages of your favorite book? Store it in your crossbody bag and start reading as soon as you're seated. \nThe exact dimensions of a personal item allowed on board vary, but a good rule of thumb is that if it fits comfortably under the seat in front of you, it's likely within the acceptable size range.\nOverhead or underfoot? The carry-on vs. personal item dilemma\nWhile the concepts sound similar, carry-on bags are not considered personal items. Carry-on bags are luggage brought onboard and stowed in the overhead bins. Personal item bags stay with you. The best way to think about it is that during the flight, you normally can't open your carry-on luggage, whereas you can easily reach and grab things out of your personal item bag. No one wants to be that person rummaging through the overhead bin to find their headphones. \nYou can also use the overhead bins for personal items, but a carry-on bag is too large to be stored beneath the seat in front of you. \nAre backpacks personal items?\nYes! If your backpack is small and compact enough to fit under the seat in front of you, it can definitely be considered a personal item. And with our design, it certainly is. The Featherlight Backpack provides the space for every necessity while remaining compact. It has an adjustable padded strap and a double-top handle that can snap close when you're no longer using it. It comes with all the accessories and pockets our sling bag and crossbody bags have, with a larger interior pocket that can hold a 14\" laptop. Additionally, it has compartments for all your goodies, including your sunglasses, water bottle, and a spare rain jacket. \nCan duffle bags be personal items? \nWell, that depends on the size. A duffle bag usually isn't considered a personal item bag, as it's normally too big to jam under the seat in front of you. A duffle bag is generally used as a weekend or overnight bag, perfect for clothing and larger items, not things you may need during the flight. For example, our Outdoor 55L Duffle would have to go in the overhead due to it's size. However, The Everywhere Bag is Away's take on a small duffle that has both room enough to pack extra items, like a raincoat and sweater, and can just fit below the seat. \nCarry-on confidently: luggage rules\nPersonal item sizes are not the same on every flight, but there are general rules that apply to most. \nAirlines typically consider the \"linear inches\" of your bag, which is the bag's total length, width, and depth. This could look like 7 x 15 x 16 inches, the maximum size of the compartment below a plane seat. \nMost airlines have specific size restrictions, so it's always wise to check your airline's guidelines before traveling to avoid surprises at the gate. When it comes to luggage on planes, size matters more than weight. \nPersonal item dimensions\nBelow are five popular airlines and their specific personal item bag restrictions:\n\n\nAmerican Airlines: 18\" x 14\" x 8\"\n\nJetBlue: 17\" x 13\" x 8\" or less. \n\nUnited Airlines: 17\" x 10\" x 9\"\n\nFrontier: 14\" x 18\" x 8\"\n\nSouthwest: 18.5\" x 13.5\" x 8.5\" \n\nLuckily, Away's Featherlight Collection is designed to suit the specific dimensions of personal item bags. There are also Carry-On bags to match, so you can find all your luggage in one place. \nChoices, choices: What to pack in a personal item bag\nWork or play? Let your trip lead when it comes to picking the bag for you. If it's a work trip, you'll want to keep your laptop, charger or notebook nearby. On the other hand, if this trip is for fun and relaxation, use that space for a book, some toiletries, and your sunhat. \nGoing on an adventure? Choose something lightweight and compact to safely store all the basics without the risk of your bag becoming a burden. After all, you want a bag that's just as set for action as you are — much like The Outdoor Backpack 26L. Versatile and succinct yet high-strength, this backpack has all the nifty compartments and places for your daily travel essentials, ideal for any explorer. \nThe do's and don'ts of personal item packing\nLet's start with some \"don'ts.\"  Remember that most planes only allow liquids if they don't exceed 100 ml. Your hand cream can likely go through, but you're not allowed to take any aerosols, gels, or other liquids that exceed this allowance. And, of course, nothing flammable or sharp is permitted. \nBut let's not dwell on the negative, here is a list of what you can bring in your personal item backpack:\nYour ticket to adventure\nWhile this may be obvious, it's the most important part of traveling and a personal item you don't want to forget. Your passport, ID document, and plane ticket are your keys to adventure, so keep them safe and close at hand. The most secure spot to stash these important documents would be a secret compartment that's both compact and closeable. Our Featherlight bags all have a handy front pocket designed just for this purpose. You may also want to make a copy or two of your ID and passport pages, just in case. \nElectronics \nWhether traveling for work or play, your electronics are bound to be by your side and need extra protection during your travels. When choosing the right personal item bag, think about one with extra padding. The Featherlight Crossbody is ideal if you're keen on keeping it light. Wearing it either crossbody or over your shoulder, it's sleek and efficient, able to carry all your personal belongings with ease and comfort. Plus, the interior compartment can hold a 16\" laptop.\nNext, you want to think about your phone and earphones, two small but valuable items. Luckily, our Featherlight Sling Bag has a hidden pocket within the strap, where you can place smaller items like your headphones. Need some more space but still want something dedicated to the delicates? The Large Featherlight Tote has a travel-ready front pocket and a hidden pocket between the bag handles perfect for phones, earphones, credit cards, etc. \nAlso, don't forget your adapters and chargers. There's nothing worse than arriving at your destination, camera in hand, only to find it's out of battery and you left the charger at home. \nReading and writing materials\nA good book, whether paperback or on e-reader, is a game-changer in those quiet moments. If you're waiting for your next flight, sitting on the train, or relaxing on the beach, something to read is a trusty companion to help you unwind and pass the time. Journaling is also a crucial aspect of traveling for some. You can either keep a daily travel journal to help you remember the smaller details or jot down notes and new contacts while on the move. Either way, having space for items like these always comes in handy. \nThe extras\nApproved toiletries and additional pieces like your sunglasses, hat, and favorite water bottle may not be essential, but they are certainly worthwhile. If you'd like that extra space, the Large Featherlight Backpack has a bigger zip pocket on the exterior front, which can comfortably hold items like sunglasses for easier access. It also has two side pockets, perfect for holding water bottles.\nIf you've packed everything else into your carry-on and just want a small bag to hold these items, you'll want something compact and seemingly weightless. The Featherlight Sling Bag is especially suited for those on-the-go travelers and is easy to bring along for adventures. \nLess is more: space-saving ways to pack your personal item bag\nYou've booked your tickets, and set your Out of Office message. Now comes the hardest part — packing. Use these tips and tricks to pack a perfect bag: \n\n\nConsider how much legroom you'll need: To make the most of your experience and be as comfy as possible, don't pack that much into your personal item bag. Don't need that extra sweater? Put it in your carry-on and stretch your legs for a more comfortable flight experience.\n\nCheck the airline's bag requirements and measure your own bag: Don't eyeball it or take a wild guess — you'll pay for the mistake in more ways than one. Remember also to consider the weight of your bag, as some airlines are more strict and will weigh your bag before check-in. \n\nThin the herd: Make a game out of your essentials list, like voting the players out of Survivor. Gather all your items, and then challenge yourself to thin your \"must haves\" by two or even five items. Ask yourself if you really need to bring two novels and a crossword puzzle book with you on your flight or if you can make do with only one book. \n\n\nThe best personal item bags for traveling \nWhen traveling, a lightweight bag is ideal as your personal item as it allows for greater flexibility and comfort. Our Featherlight bags are optimized for organization and equipped with travel-ready pockets for easy access to belongings. This keeps everything safe but within reach — no more fumbling for your goods when standing in the queue (don't worry, we've all been there).\nYou know how awesome it feels when everything just... matches? When your carry-on suitcase is in perfect harmony with your personal item, it can be both aesthetically pleasing and fun. Our extensive range of Carry-On suitcases is designed to pair perfectly with our personal items bags, so you can mix and match to your heart's content.  \nTraveling stress-free and in style\nNow that you've got your personal item packing guide ready for your next trip, you can arrive at the airport (relatively) stress-free. You've got your essentials, with your passport safe and within reach, and your sunglasses are easily accessible for the second you hit the beach. No unexpected check-ins here. Just remember that as long as your bag of belongings fits snugly under the seat in front of you, you're good to go. \nGot the luggage but still need the bag? We've got you. Browse our new range of personal item bags in our Featherlight Collection, from stylish tote bags to adventurous backpacks. With Away, you can explore further and travel lighter. ","headline":"Sky's the Limit: Your Guide To Personal Item Sizes","description":"Learn about personal item bags for traveling, including dimensions, restrictions, and Away's tips to help you travel with ease and avoid unnecessary fees.","image":"https:\/\/www.awaytravel.com\/cdn\/shop\/articles\/66cf6bf4789ae49b626ed5ff_Featherlight_0094_Web_1920x823_354e7618-0649-44d7-b9ac-c7070d1d6a59.jpg?v=1746463310\u0026width=1920","datePublished":"2024-11-14T10:05:00-05:00","dateModified":"2024-11-14T10:04:59-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lindsay Stork"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Away: Built for modern travel"}}

The best way to think about it is that during the flight, you normally can't open your carry-on luggage, whereas you can easily reach and grab things out of your personal item bag. No one wants to be that person rummaging through the overhead bin to find their headphones. </p>
