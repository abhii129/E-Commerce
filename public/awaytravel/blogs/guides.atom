<h4>Take care</h4>
<p>KEEP IT CLEAN</p>
<p>You can clean your suitcase’s exterior and interior using a soft damp cloth and mild soap. Keep in mind that an aluminum suitcase is like an open passport—you can see everywhere it’s been (and that’s a good thing). So don’t fuss over every scuff and scratch on your bag— each mark has a story behind it. </p>
<p>STOW AWAY</p>
<p>Store in a cool, well-ventilated place with low humidity, if you can.<br>‍</p>
<h4>On the outside</h4>
<p>Your suitcase is made from an aluminum alloy designed to be sturdy and highly protective of everything you pack inside. Over the years and miles together, your suitcase will develop a character all its own, showing the marks and signs of all your travels. To us, that’s a beautiful thing.</p>
<h4>On the inside</h4>
<p>TO THE LEFT Ⓐ</p>
<p>This side has a zippered mesh enclosure, designed  to store hard, bulky, and non-compressible items like shoes or toiletries.</p>
<p>ON THE RIGHT Ⓑ</p>
<p>This side’s perfect for clothing and anything else that’s soft and easy to press down. Pile up your clothes, buckle the compression pad Ⓒ, and tighten the straps to pack it all in. Use our<a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/accessories/packing-cubes-four" data-mce-href="https://www.awaytravel.com/accessories/packing-cubes-four"><span> </span>Insider Packing Cubes<span> </span></a>to stay organized and save even more space. The compression pad also has a mesh pocket for laptops, tablets, or magazines. Unzip the small pouch Ⓓ at the base of your suitcase and voilà: a removable laundry bag.</p>
<h4>You’re covered</h4>
<p>OUR LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTY</p>
<p>This suitcase is designed to last and is guaranteed by a limited lifetime warranty that covers any functional damage to the shell, wheels, handles, zippers, and many other elements of our luggage.

<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">Open &amp; set your lock</h4>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">When you first receive your new Softside suitcase, the padlock will be inside the top compression pad pocket, and it is preset to open at 0-0-0, even though dials may be positioned at other numbers. To change the combination follow these steps:</p>
<ol role="list" data-mce-fragment="1">
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Turn the dials and align the numbers to 0-0-0 (or the current combination, if different).</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Pull up the shackle and turn it counterclockwise 90°</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Press the shackle all the way down, hold it and turn the dials to set your combination. Then let go and scramble the digits.</li>
<li data-mce-fragment="1">Return the shackle back to the original position. Your personal combination is now ready to use.</li>
</ol>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">To reset the lock, repeat steps 1-4 starting with your existing combination. We suggest taking a minute now to email the combo to yourself, tuck it into your passport, or save it as a contact in your phone in case you lock yourself out later.</p>

<h4>On the outside</h4>
<p>Your suitcase is made from a soft, high-strength nylon exterior. The front lid opening (A) ensures easy access to your belongings even when space is tight (looking at you airplane aisles!). Attach the padlock to both zippers (B) to keep everything you pack secure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two hidden, easy-access front pockets (C) are padded to protect all of your belongings. Perfect for laptops, wallets, books, passports, or anything you need to access quickly while traveling.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>For times when you need extra room to pack, just unzip the expansion zipper (D) to create more space. The bottom grab handle (E) makes it especially easy to lift and maneuver your suitcase in and out of overhead bins.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>On the inside</h4>
<p>Your suitcase is packed (pun intended) with features that make organizing and fitting everything a breeze.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>THE LID (A)</p>
<p>The lid includes one or two (depending on size) small organization pockets (C) for flat or soft items.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>THE MAIN COMPARTMENT (B)</p>
<p>Pack up your clothes, buckle the compression pad (D), and tighten the straps (E) to pack it all in. Also included are two organization pockets in the compression pad and a hanging pocket (F) for small items. Use our<span> </span><a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/accessories/packing-cubes-four">Insider Packing Cubes</a><span> </span>to stay even more organized and make unpacking/repacking a breeze.</p>
<p>When you first receive your suitcase you can also find the lock and laundry bag inside of the compression pad pockets.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Care</h4>
<p>‍</p>
<p>KEEP IT CLEAN</p>
<p>Treat your luggage well and it’ll return the favor. Use a washcloth and mild soap to wipe your suitcase clean and remove any minor marks it picks up on your travels together.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>STOW AWAY</p>
<p>When you’re not traveling, keep your suitcase somewhere safe and out of the way. If you have multiple sizes, nest them to save space.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h4>In your pocket</h4>
<p><sub>(If your suitcase doesn't have a pocket, you can skip ahead.)</sub></p>
<p>Your Carry-On’s front pocket gives you instant access to the things you want nearby on the road (laptop, passport, crosswords, etc.), and is designed to stand up to everything from inclement weather to rough baggage handlers.</p>
<p>Ⓐ A shallow zippered pocket for the things you need to grab or stow quickly, like boarding passes.</p>
<p>Ⓑ An interior zippered pocket for keeping your passport, wallet, or phone safe.</p>
<p>Ⓒ The ideal spot to store your laptop for easy access and extra protection, cushioned with mesh neoprene and reinforced by the shell of your suitcase itself.</p>
<p>Ⓓ Zipper pulls can accommodate a small lock for extra safety.</p>
<p>If you choose to check your Carry-On, we recommend removing your laptop (and anything else fragile) and taking it into the cabin with you.</p>

<h4 data-mce-fragment="1">Get to know your battery</h4>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Your Carry-On has a battery that can be easily accessed by flipping open the lid under your bag’s handle.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">YOU’LL FIND</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Ⓐ LED LIGHTS:<span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span></strong>These indicate how much power your battery has left.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Ⓑ MICRO-USB PORT:<span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span></strong>This is where you’ll plug in the included cable to charge your battery. Use the wall adapter to plug in to any outlet. We recommend charging overnight before traveling.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Ⓒ STANDARD USB PORT WITH 1A OUTPUT:<span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span></strong>This port charges your phone or device at a standard speed.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Ⓓ STANDARD USB PORT WITH 2.1A OUTPUT:<span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span></strong>This port charges your phone or device at a faster speed.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Both standard USB ports can be used at the same time. When charging your battery, make sure that no devices are plugged in to the other USB ports.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><strong data-mce-fragment="1">Warning:<span data-mce-fragment="1"> </span></strong>This battery is not designed to be charged from a laptop USB port.</p>
<h4>Removing your battery</h4>
<p>HERE’S HOW</p>
<p>Flip open the charging port, push down on your battery, and let go. It will pop right out.<span> </span><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong><span> </span>We have found that if your bag is packed full, the pressure on the battery case can sometimes prevent the battery from popping out. Here are some tips that may help:</p>
<ol role="list" start="">
<li>Unzip the bag just a few inches at the top to relieve pressure before ejecting the battery</li>
<li>Shift an item or two at the very top of the bag</li>
<li>Plug a USB cord into the port to fish out the battery</li>
</ol>
<p>If your battery is not popping out even when the bag is empty, we can get you set up with a repair.<span> </span><a href="https://help.awaytravel.com/contact/form-By3J5fbj">Reach out to us</a></p>
<p>HERE’S WHY</p>

<h4>Take care</h4>
<p>KEEP IT CLEAN</p>
<p>A washcloth and mild soap will remove any minor scuffs, and the included melamine sponge will take care of the more stubborn marks. </p>
<p>STOW AWAY</p>
<p>When you’re not traveling, keep your suitcase somewhere safe and out of the way. If you have multiple sizes, nest them to save space.  <br></p>
<h4>On the outside</h4>
<p>Your suitcase is made from a lightweight and durable polycarbonate shell that has a little flex to it, letting you fit more in. For times when you need extra room to pack, just unzip the expansion zipper to create more space. The expandable feature is made from durable nylon that’s been reinforced so it’ll stand up to even the roughest baggage handlers. Finally, the handle at the bottom of your suitcase makes it easy to lift, grab, and go.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>On the inside</h4>
<p>TO THE LEFT Ⓐ</p>
<p>This side has a zippered mesh enclosure, designed to store hard, bulky, and non compressible items like shoes or toiletries.</p>
<p>ON THE RIGHT Ⓑ</p>
<p>This side’s perfect for clothing and anything else that’s soft and easy to press down. Pile up your clothes, buckle the compression pad Ⓒ, and tighten the straps to pack it all in. Use our<span> </span><a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/products/packing-cubes-four-jet-black">Insider Packing Cubes</a><span> </span>to stay organized and save even more space. The compression pad also has a mesh pocket for laptops, tablets, or magazines.</p>
<p>Unzip the small pouch Ⓓ at the base of your suitcase and voilà: a removable laundry bag.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>You’re covered</h4>
<p>OUR LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTY</p>
<p>This suitcase is designed to last and is guaranteed by a limited lifetime warranty that covers any functional damage to the shell, wheels, handles, zippers, and many other elements of our luggage.

<p><strong>Gloss finish:</strong><span> </span>The best way to clean your Gloss suitcase’s shell is to use a microfiber cloth and glass cleaner. We don’t recommend using a magic eraser, as it could cause damage to the Gloss finish. To repair any scratches, apply a dime-sized portion of car polish to the scratched area and gently rub with a microfiber cloth until the scratches are improved or removed. Allow the luggage to dry for 2-3 minutes.</p>

<p>CHOOSE, SET, AND SAVE YOUR COMBINATION.</p>
<p>When you first receive your new Softside suitcase, the padlock will be inside the top compression pad pocket, and it is preset to open at 0-0-0, even though dials may be positioned at other numbers. To change the combination follow these steps:</p>
<ol role="list">
<li>Turn the dials and align the numbers to 0-0-0 (or the current combination, if different).</li>
<li>Pull up the shackle and turn it counterclockwise 90°</li>
<li>Press the shackle all the way down, hold it and turn the dials to set your combination. Then let go and scramble the digits.</li>
<li>Return the shackle back to the original position. Your personal combination is now ready to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>To reset the lock, repeat steps 1-4 starting with your existing combination. We suggest taking a minute now to email the combo to yourself, tuck it into your passport, or save it as a contact in your phone in case you lock yourself out later.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting tips</h4>
<p>THE LOCK OPENS TO ANY COMBINATION</p>
<p>If TSA gets into your bag, it's possible the locks will open to any combination. In order to reset the lock to open at your combination, follow the directions below:</p>
<ol start="" role="list">
<li>Turn the bag to face you with the lock in front of you (the handle being at the top)</li>
<li>Find the TSA lock slot that is to the right of the red diamond shape</li>
<li>Find a small object that can fit in that little TSA lock space</li>
<li>Turn the TSA lock slot so the 2 ends of the slot are pointing towards the arrow and red dot</li>
</ol>
<p>This should work to straighten up that lock and reset it to the code that you set!<br>‍<br>FORGOT YOUR COMBINATION?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only way to unlock the suitcase is to set the correct combination.</p>
